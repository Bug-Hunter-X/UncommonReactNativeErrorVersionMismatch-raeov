This error occurs when you are using a library that requires a specific version of React Native, but your project is using a different version. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  For example, if a library is built for React Native 0.64, but your project is using 0.63, you may encounter this error. The error message will not specifically say "React Native Version Mismatch", but instead it will manifest as various other errors that stem from incompatibility.
