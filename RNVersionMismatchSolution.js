The solution involves carefully examining your `package.json` file and ensuring all dependencies are compatible with your current React Native version. Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to trace dependency trees and identify conflicts.  If incompatibilities exist, consider using version ranges in your `package.json` or seeking alternative compatible libraries. You can often use the following code in your package.json to specify a specific version or a range of versions for a library:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "react-native": "^0.71.8",
  "my-library": "^1.2.3"
}
```

Using a range (e.g., ^1.2.3) allows minor version updates, but you might need to pin versions exactly if serious incompatibilities arise.  Always check the documentation of your libraries for their compatibility requirements with your React Native version.
