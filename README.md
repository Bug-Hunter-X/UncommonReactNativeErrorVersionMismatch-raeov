The example showcases how such conflicts can lead to cryptic error messages, and it provides a clear solution to address these inconsistencies.  The `RNVersionMismatch.js` file demonstrates a scenario where an outdated library causes issues. The `RNVersionMismatchSolution.js` showcases the fix using compatible versions.
